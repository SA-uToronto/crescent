# CReSCENT: CanceR Single Cell ExpressioN Toolkit

CReSCENT is an intuitive and scalable web portal incorporating a containerized pipeline execution engine for standardized analysis of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data. [Pre-print at BioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.27.012740v2).

This repository contains applications implemented for CReSCENT. Scripts work as one-line-commands using the R library(optparse). We also provide a Graphic User Interface (GUI) web version ready to be used without the user needing to install any sotware at https://crescent.cloud. CReSCENT's GUI has its own repository at https://github.com/pughlab/crescent-frontend.

This repository has three main directories: `bin`, `doc` and `examples`. `bin` contains the applications code, `doc` contains documentation, including dependencies, and `examples` provides links to inputs and expected outputs.

bin
================
Contains codes to run CReSCENT analysis pipelines as one-line-command applications.

doc
================
Contains documentation associated with `bin/codes`, including parameters and dependencies.

examples
================
Contains examples associated with `bin/codes`, such as links to example infiles and outfiles.
